### Installation

##### Supported platforms
* Linux
* Windows
* Mac

##### Requirements
* python 2+

##### For Linux
Install **python** and just use **pip** command to install **socli**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-pip
sudo pip install socli
```
##### For Windows
###### Method 1 (Using Installer)
Download and install the latest release of [SoCLI-Setup.exe](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/socli/releases/latest/) for windows. It is a self contained package with all the required dependencies.
Add SoCLI directory to windows path. See [this page](http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path) for more info. If you are running 64bit version of windows add `C:\Program Files (x86)\SoCLI` to the path, else add `C:\Program Files\SoCLI` to the path. This method doesn't support the command line updating of SoCLI, you must manually uninstall the program and reinstall the new versions.

###### Method 2 (Using PIP)
[Download and install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Dont forget to check the option "Add to path".

Open a command prompt with administrative privileges and use **pip** command to install **socli**:
```bash
pip install socli
```
Use **easy_install** if your python path have a space in it [Read more:"Failed to create process"](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/socli/issues/6):
```
easy_install socli
```

##### For Mac (via homebrew)
Install **python** and **socli**:
```bash
brew install python
easy_install pip
pip install socli
```
### Updating
Use the command below to update your existing version of **socli** to the newest version, so that you won't miss any features:
```bash
sudo pip install --upgrade socli
```

### Usage
##### Quick search
Just use **socli** command followed by the search query:
```bash
socli for loop in python syntax

```

The above command will search for the query "*for loop in python syntax*" and displays the first most voted question in stack overflow with its most voted answer. Pretty quick, right?

##### Interactive search
You can search the stack overflow interactively by using the command below:
```sh
socli -iq html error 404
```

This will display a list of questions from stack overflow for the query "*html error 404*" and it will allow you to choose any of the question you like interactively. When you chose a question, it will display the complete description of the chosed question with its most voted answer. Now you can browse through all the answers of that questions on stack overflow interactively.

##### Manual search
This will allow you to choose a question number for example:
```sh
socli -r 2 -q javascript porotype function
```
Will search for "*javascript porotype function*" in stack overflow and displays the second question that contains it.

##### Topic based search
Stack overflow supports topic by using tags. **socli** allows you to query stack overflow based on specific tags.  Just specify the tag via the following command:
```sh
socli -t javascript -q window.open
```
You can also specify multiple tags, Just seporate them with a comma:
```sh
socli -t javascript,node.js -q window.open
```
See the complete list of tags [here](http://stackoverflow.com/tags).


##### New question
If you can't find an answer for your question in stack overflow, **socli** allows you to creata a new question via the web browswer. Just type the command below and **socli** will open the new question page of stack overflow in the web browser for you:
```sh
socli -n
```

```

```
